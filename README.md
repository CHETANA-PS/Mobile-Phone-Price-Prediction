Mobile-Phone-Price-Prediction
"Machine learning model to predict mobile phone prices based on features like battery, RAM, and screen size. Built using Linear Regression, with data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to improve model accuracy."

Project Overview:
This project uses machine learning to predict mobile phone prices based on various features such as battery capacity, RAM, and screen size. The model is developed using Python and the "Linear Regression" algorithm.

Tools and Libraries:
Python(Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
Matplotlib,Seaborn for data visualization

Dataset:
The dataset contains over 1,000 data points with features like battery capacity, RAM, screen size, and more.

Steps:
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Model training using Linear Regression.
4. Accuracy of the model: 85%.
